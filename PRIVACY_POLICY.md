  - Analytics and telemetry

- Checking for updates or announcements from mod developers
- Understanding that we cannot control or predict changes made by third parties

## Children's Privacy

Restaurats Mod Manager does not knowingly collect data from anyone, including children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age of digital consent in your jurisdiction). Since we collect no data, there is no risk of inadvertently collecting children's information.

When we make changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically. 

## International Users

Restaurats Mod Manager can be used globally.  Since we do not collect or process any user data, international data transfer regulations (such as GDPR, CCPA, etc.) do not apply to our application.  However, third-party components like BepInEx and individual mods may be subject to such regulations.

## Legal Compliance

While we do not collect data and therefore have minimal privacy obligations, we are committed to:
- Operating transparently and in good faith
- Complying with applicable open-source software licenses
- Respecting user rights and autonomy
- Being responsive to legitimate legal requests (though we have no user data to provide)
